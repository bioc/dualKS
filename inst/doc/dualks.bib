  abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool
	in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information
	remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical
	method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting
	gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on
	gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological
	function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how
	GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including
	leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds
	little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival
	in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common.
	The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package,
	together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene
	sets.},
